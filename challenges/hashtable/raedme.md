# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* This challenge is Hash Table

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

  1. add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
  2. get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
  3. contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
  4. hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
*  hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* returns the value from the table.
* returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
