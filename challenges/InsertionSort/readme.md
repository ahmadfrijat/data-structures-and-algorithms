# Selection Sort
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses the array multiple times as it slowly builds out the sorting sequence. The traversal keeps track of the minimum value and places it in the front of the array which should be incrementally sorted.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Write a function called SelectionSort
