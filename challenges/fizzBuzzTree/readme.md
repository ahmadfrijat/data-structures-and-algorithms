# fizz Buzz Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
    1. If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    2. If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    3. If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
    4. If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
