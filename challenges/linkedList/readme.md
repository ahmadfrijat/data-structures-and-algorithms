# linked list
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge 
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
## Approach & Efficiency

## Challenge 2
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Define a method called append , Define a method called insertBefore and Define a method called insertAfter
