<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
