# Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
* Create a BinaryTree class Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

* Create a BinarySearchTree class
* Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
* Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
## Approach & Efficiency

# find-maximum-binary-tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Create a find-maximum-value method .
