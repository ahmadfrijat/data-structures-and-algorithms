# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* what i did is Writing a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, and return an array with elements in reversed order.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* To start at the end of the array we want to set i equal to the length of the array minus 1, since the index of an array always starts at zero.
* Iterate the array with a for loop, each time pushing the new value to the new array.
